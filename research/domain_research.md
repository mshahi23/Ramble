We have to build essentially a social media app for long-form posts which according to our developers really resembles Tumblr. It is a social media where communities can be built and where users can share absolutely anything. It can be used as a forum for people looking for help or information or for people who wish to have personal pages where they can share their hobbies and everyday lives with other people. It can also be used for essayists, writers and other people who wish to post their work to larger audiences.

In other words, the audience for this project is really large. Users can be teenagers or elder people, hobbyists, writers or even artists.

There is a variety of social media apps nowadays and most of them have different purposes:

Reddit is sort of like a forum where smaller communities can be built and people can simply post things that interest them and appeal to that specific community and have people comment on it, share their opinions and create discussions.

Twitter is sort of a jack of all trade social media where people have their own pages and share their thoughts but it doesn't support long-form posts due to the character limit (even though a lot of people make threads nowadays). Twitter is a great way of reaching a large audience and following other people's activity.

Instagram is the main social media for people who want to document their lives through photography. It does not support written posts, as users can only post images with captions.

One thing that is good about these websites is that they are all responsive and all have useful services. If you look up something or want an answer, reddit probably has it. If you are looking for entertainment or a community, you could probably find it on Twitter. 

All of these websites are also very responsive and they also have pretty regular updates. 

They all have 'report' features to report bad users and they all have user help services to keep users satisfied.
