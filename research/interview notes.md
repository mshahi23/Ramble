## Takeaways from interviews

### Participant 1: Tommy Lee

1) I mainly use social media apps and forums for entertainment. They usually have a lot of interesting things and it's easy to use them when I'm bored/don't feel like doing anything.

2) I mainly use YouTube and Reddit.

3) I use social media apps for interacting with friends. For high-level research, I'll also use YouTube or Reddit.

4) I like the YouTube user interface. It's pretty straightforward where the sidebar on the left is for more specific stuff like subscriptions, the top is for the search bar, and the rest of the screen is for videos and descriptions about said video. There are timestamps for the video and if you hover them, you can preview the video to see if it may be interesting or not.

5) One major turnoff are pop-ups that obstruct the usage of the app. For YouTube, it would be the ads that play when you try to play a video. For Reddit, if you browse on your phone, it sometimes does not allow you to see the post unless you download the app.

6) I usually search on Google and YouTube. I'll mainly use Google, but if I sometimes find the topic hard to follow, I'll search on YouTube
Additional Notes: I have a set of specific subreddits that I browse. But for the most part itâ€™s mindless browsing


### Participant 2: Kevin Yuan

1) In a social media app, I want an app that visually looks appealing. I don't like cluttered UIs and I like bright vibrant colors. I like it when I can easily view the posts of my friends and family and other groups that I follow. I look for apps that don't have many ads. And I like apps that recommend content to me.
When it comes to forums, I frequently browse reddit and occasionally twitter. I usually do that to check up on popular news and to just pass some time.

2) FB: I mostly use Facebook only for messenger. Personally, I feel like FB is outdated and only really used by the older generation.
Snapchat: I have snapchat but I barely use it
Instagram: I really like Instagram and it's my go-to for browsing content and posts. I really enjoy the smooth experience. I also occasionally use it for DMs

3) I do not use social media for research, because I do not trust content I find on social media, and I find it very hard to do any research on social media. Sometimes I do research on reddit though, especially if it's regarding recent and controversial news (cause I enjoy the "grassroot" discussions). When it comes to game posts (like league patches), reddit is my GOTO place to view these things because I usually first see them when scrolling through reddit. I mainly use social media for interaction with friends and family: DMs and posts. (edited)

4) I really like the Instagram interface. It employs a lot of bright colors and pretty icons. I also like it when I can give feedback on posts, like Likes and Dislikes and Comments. Otherwise, I feel that my experience might be too static. I would definitely be interested in some more engaging interactions though!

5) I hate seeing censorship. I was also a bit upset when reddit removed the dislike option (or like removed the ability to see dislikes). I also hate ads. And I hate it when the recommendations algorithms bomb me with useless content or content I only searched once. (edited)

6) I google or look up reddit. If the topic belongs to one of the groups that I belong to on reddit, then I just go directly to reddit because usually it would be there, and I would be able to view discussions regarding the topic, which is the aspect I enjoy the most


### Participant 3: Abhinav Siwakoti

1)
- Being able to create and view profile and make "friends" or "follow" them.
- Able to send a DM
- Have a place to share anything (texts, pictures, videos, files). "Posts"

2) Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, Twitter, Viber

3) I use social media for research and interaction.

4) Instagram and Twitter (Story on Instagram) (Twitter is easy to nagivate)

5) Too much ads (YouTube) and strict community rules for unnesscary stuff.(Facebook)

6) A simple google search with the term reddit added always leads me to reddit discussions or quora forums in that topic. For videos YouTube is always the one to go to.
